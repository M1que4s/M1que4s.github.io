  home_about_1: "I am a young passionate about programming in Lua. I'm pretty new in the programming world, since I just started getting into it approximately in 2016, starting with web stuff like HTML and CSS, then I went through C and now I'm in Lua. Honestly, there are a lot of things I don't know yet, but eventually plan to learn about it.",
  home_about_2: "I know about GTK since I started with C and since then I love it, although at the time I didn't understand exactly how it worked, today I find it a little easier to understand and use it.",
  home_about_3: "I'm also a long time Linux user (since 2011 or 2012 approximately), one of the distributions that caught my attention back then was Arch, but I couldn't use it until early 2020 as I had no idea how to install it on my laptop, so I left it for \"when I have more experience\" (in the end someone helped me, I'm still a Linux newbie, lmao).",
