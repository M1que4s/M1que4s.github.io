          .column.is-11.is-desktop-9.is-desktop-x-8.
            and welcome to my website. I'm a young and passionate Lua developer, GTK fan and (Arch) Linux user from Venezuela. Check out (a bit) more about me and my projects.

            h2 About me

            p I am a Venezuelan passionate about programming in Lua. I'm pretty new in the programming world, since I just started getting into it approximately in 2016, starting with web stuff like HTML and CSS, then I went through C and now I'm in Lua. Honestly, there are a lot of things I don't know yet, but eventually plan to learn about it.

            p I've known about GTK since I knew C and just loved it and although at the time I didn't understand exactly how it worked, today it's getting a little easier for me to understand and use it.

            p I've also been a Linux user for a while now (since 2011 or 2012 approximately), one of the distributions that caught my attention back then was Arch, but I couldn't use it until early 2020 since I had no idea how to install it on my laptop, so I just left it "for when I have more experience" (in the end someone helped me, I'm still a Linux newbie, lmao).

            p I am currently living in Colombia and here I have been able to work on small personal projects.
