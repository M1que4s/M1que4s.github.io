I'm pretty new in the programming world, since I just started getting into it approximately in 2016, starting with web stuff like HTML and CSS, then I went through C and now I'm in Lua. Honestly, there are a lot of things I don't know yet, but eventually plan to learn about it.</p><p>I know about GTK since I started with C and since then I love it, although at the time I didn't understand exactly how it worked, today I find it a little easier to understand and use it.</p><p>I'm also a long time Linux user (since 2011 or 2012 approximately), one of the distributions that caught my attention back then was Arch, but I couldn't use it until early 2020 as I had no idea how to install it on my laptop, so I left it "for when I have more experience" (in the end someone helped me, I'm still a Linux newbie, lmao).</p><p>I am currently living in Colombia and here I have been able to work on small personal projects.</p></div></div></div><!-- "Portfolio"--><div class="hero"><div class="hero__content grid has-centered"><div class="column is-11"><h2>Projects</h2><p>Please, note that not all projects are finished.</p></div><div class="column is-11 grid"><div class="column is-mobile-half is-6"><h4>Moonplayer</h4><p>[WIP] Gtk music player written in pure Lua</p><a href="https://github.com/Miqueas/Moonplayer">Source code</a></div><div class="column is-mobile-half is-6"><h4>Logit</h4><p>Small, simple and easy to use log utility for Lua</p><a href="https://github.com/Miqueas/Logit">Source code</a></div><div class="column is-mobile-half is-6"><h4>Self</h4><p>Simple and compact OOP library for Lua</p><a href="https://github.com/Miqueas/Self">Source code</a></div><div class="column is-mobile-half is-6"><h4>Static</h4><p>Basic support for static typing in Lua</p><a href="https://github.com/Miqueas/Static">Source code</a></div><div class="column is-mobile-half is-6"><h4>Github-REST-API-Example</h4><p>Basic example of the Github REST API in various languages</p><a href="https://github.com/Miqueas/Github-REST-API-Example">Source code</a></div><div class="column is-mobile-half is-6"><h4>TermColors</h4><p>Colorize your Lua script output with a easy to use markup</p><a href="https://github.com/Miqueas/TermColors">Source code</a></div></div></div></div></div>
